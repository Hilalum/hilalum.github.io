**Last Updated: December 22, 2025**

## Introduction

Thank you for using **RoomBoard** ("the App"). This application is a client designed specifically for Apple TV, allowing users to conveniently access and control their Home Assistant services.

We value your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your information.

## Data Collection and Use

**We explicitly state: This App does not collect, store, or share any of your personal information with any third parties.**

1.  **Data Ownership**: Your home data belongs entirely to you. The App serves solely as a tool for display and control and does not perform any data mining.
2.  **Direct Connection**: The App communicates directly with the Home Assistant instance that you host or configure yourself. All network requests (such as retrieving device status or sending control commands) occur directly between your Apple TV device and your Home Assistant server.
3.  **No Backend Services**: The App does not have a backend server maintained by the developer. We cannot access your home data, login credentials, or usage habits.
4.  **Local Storage**: Your configuration information (such as server address, access tokens, etc.) is stored only in the secure storage area (e.g., Keychain) of your local Apple TV device, solely for the purpose of connecting the App to your Home Assistant instance.

## Third-Party Services

The App interacts with **Home Assistant** via its official API.

*   **Home Assistant**: As a client, the functionality of this App relies on your personal Home Assistant service. For privacy practices regarding Home Assistant itself, please refer to its official documentation; however, this typically depends on your own server configuration.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

Although we do not strictly collect any data at present, we will update this privacy policy if the App's functionality changes significantly in the future (e.g., introducing new features requiring cloud support). Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
