# Privacy Policy for TeslaBoard

**Last updated: February 1, 2026**

## Introduction

At **TeslaBoard** ("we," "our," or "us"), we prioritize the privacy and security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how our application collects, uses, and protects your data when you use our Apple TV application.

By using TeslaBoard, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information We Collect

### Tesla Account Information
To function, TeslaBoard requires access to your Tesla account. We collect:
*   **Authentication Tokens:** Specifically, the OAuth Access Token and Refresh Token provided by you or generated via the Tesla login process.
*   **Vehicle Data:** Basic vehicle information (e.g., VIN, model, name) and real-time status data (e.g., battery level, location, charging status, climate settings) fetched directly from Tesla's servers.

### Location Data
We access your vehicle's location data to display its position on the map interface within the app. This data is fetched directly from Tesla and displayed locally on your device.

## How We Use Your Information

*   **To Provide Service:** We use your tokens to authenticate requests to the official Tesla API. This allows the app to display your vehicle's status on your TV.
*   **Local Processing:** All data fetching and processing happens locally on your Apple TV.

## Data Storage and Security

**We take your security seriously.**

*   **No Intermediate Servers:** TeslaBoard communicates **directly** with Tesla's official servers. Your data does **not** pass through any third-party servers owned or operated by us.
*   **Secure Storage:** Your sensitive Authentication Tokens (Refresh Token and Access Token) are encrypted and stored securely in the **Apple tvOS Keychain**. This is the standard, secure storage mechanism provided by Apple.
*   **Data Retention:** We do not retain your vehicle history or personal data on external servers. All temporary data cached for display is stored locally on your device.

## Third-Party Services

*   **Tesla API:** The app relies on the third-party API provided by Tesla Inc. Use of your Tesla account is subject to Tesla's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
*   **Apple:** As an iOS/tvOS application, some anonymized analytics (e.g., crash reports) may be collected by Apple if you have opted into sharing analytics with developers.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
